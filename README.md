No need to *hop* to the Sidebar to work with files. üòú

## Consolidated lists for quick file selection

For some file actions, we can consolidate the list of files into a single list for quick selection.

Take the command, `File Bunny: Move Active File`. A QuickPick dialog lets you choose a destination from all folders (and subfolders) in your workspace.

![move active file demo](img/move-file.gif)

The list is narrowed down to matched selections as you type, the same as the Command Palette.

You can exclude folders from the list with the `excludes` settings option to keep the list concise.

## Incremental completion to find files quickly

Incremental completion builds a filepath quickly. This is achieved through a QuickPick dialog populated with a file list, and tabbed autocompletion to append each segment.

Take the command, `File Bunny: Open a Folder`.

![open folder demo](img/open-folder.gif)

In this example, I do the following to open my *Beer Advisor* project:

1. Type "and", which highlights  the *Android* folder as the first option. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select it.
2. Type "beer", which highlights the *beer-advisor* folder as the first option. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select it.
3. Accept the current directory (first option) by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open it.

This process of building paths is quick and mitigates errors drastically. You cannot create an incorrect path.

You can also walk the file system with the arrow keys. Use the left arrow to go back, and right arrow to go forward through the file system if you need to search.

## Actions on the active file

Quite often, you want to do something to a file you're already working on. Why re-find the file in the sidebar to perform an action?

![delete active file demo](img/delete-file.gif)

For example, the command  `File Bunny: Delete Active File` will immediately delete the active file (it ends up in the trash).

After the file is deleted, focus is switched to the next open file. This way you can carry on editing without needing to switch view to return to an active state. Other extensions don't do this!

## Destructive actions are safe

If you delete a file, it is sent to the trash (recycle bin).

If you create, move, or duplicate a file, overwriting another file or folder is not possible.

## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

1. `File Bunny: Create New File`: Create a new file in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Move Active File`: Move the active file to another location in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Duplicate Active File`: Copy the active file and place it somewhere in the current workspace.
