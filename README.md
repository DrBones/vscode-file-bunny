Perform file operations quickly with keyboard driven file selection, and contextually-intelligent commands. No need to jump to the sidebar to move or a delete a file.

## Consolidated lists for quick file selection

For some actions, we can consolidate the list of files into a single list for quick selection. For example, to **move a  file**, a QuickPick dialog lets you choose from all folders (and subfolders) in your workspace.

![move active file demo](img/move-file.gif)

It narrows the list to matched selections as you type, the same as the Command Palette.

You can exclude folders from the list with the `excludes` settings option to keep the list lean.

## Incremental completion to find files quickly

Modal file dialogs suck! It would be more efficient to use the keyboard to find files directly. We can do this intelligently with incremental completion to build a filepath quickly.

This is achieved through a QuickPick dialog populated with the file list, and tabbed autocompletion to append each segment.

Take the command, **`File Bunny: Open a Folder`**.

![open folder demo](img/open-folder.gif)

In this example, I do the following to open my *Beer Advisor* project:

1. Type "and", which highlights  the *Android* folder as the first option. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select it.
2. Type "beer", which highlights the *beer-advisor* folder as the first option. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select it.
3. Accept the current directory (first option) by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open it.

This process of building paths is quick and mitigates errors drastically. You cannot create an incorrect path.

You can also walk the file system with the arrow keys. Use the left arrow to go back, and right arrow to go forward through the file system if you need to search.

## Actions on the active file

Quite often, you want to do something to a file you're already working on. Why re-find in the file explorer in the sidebar to perform an action?

![delete active file demo](img/delete-file.gif)

Just run a command such as `File Bunny: Delete active file` and poof! It's gone (well, in the trash to be technically correct).

After the file is deleted, focus is switched to the next open file. This way you can carry on editing without needing to switch view. Other extensions don't do this!

## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

1. `File Bunny: Open Folder`: Open a folder as a project.
1. `File Bunny: Move the Active File`: Move the active file to another location in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Delete the Active File`: Delete the active file. The file is put into the trash (recycle bin).

## Settings

- `Filebunny: Excludes`: Configure glob patterns for excluding files and folders when selecting files.
