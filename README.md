Perform file actions quickly with keyboard-driven file selection, and contextually-intelligent commands. No need to jump to the Sidebar to work with files.

## Consolidated lists for quick file selection

For some file actions, we can consolidate the list of files into a single list for quick selection.

For example, to move the active file, a QuickPick dialog lets you choose a destination from all folders (and subfolders) in your workspace.

![move active file demo](img/move-file.gif)

The list is narrowed down to matched selections as you type, the same as the Command Palette.

You can exclude folders from the list with the `excludes` settings option to keep the list concise.

## Incremental completion to find files quickly

Incremental completion builds a filepath quickly. This is achieved through a QuickPick dialog populated with a file list, and tabbed autocompletion to append each segment.

Take the command, **`File Bunny: Open a Folder`**.

![open folder demo](img/open-folder.gif)

In this example, I do the following to open my *Beer Advisor* project:

1. Type "and", which highlights  the *Android* folder as the first option. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select it.
2. Type "beer", which highlights the *beer-advisor* folder as the first option. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select it.
3. Accept the current directory (first option) by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open it.

This process of building paths is quick and mitigates errors drastically. You cannot create an incorrect path.

You can also walk the file system with the arrow keys. Use the left arrow to go back, and right arrow to go forward through the file system if you need to search.

## Actions on the active file

Quite often, you want to do something to a file you're already working on. Why re-find the file in the sidebar to perform an action?

![delete active file demo](img/delete-file.gif)

For example, run the command  `File Bunny: Delete active file` and poof! It's gone (well, in the trash to be technically correct).

After the file is deleted, focus is switched to the next open file. This way you can carry on editing without needing to switch view. Other extensions don't do this!

## Destructive actions are safe

If you delete a file, it is sent to the trash (recycle bin).

If you create, move, or duplicate a file, overwriting another file or folder is not possible.

## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

1. `File Bunny: Create New File`: Create a new file for the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Move the Active File`: Move the active file to another location in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Duplicate Active File`: Copy the active file and place it somewhere in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Rename Active File`
1. `File Bunny: Delete the Active File`: Delete the active file. The file is put into the trash (recycle bin).
1. `File Bunny: Open Folder`: Open a folder as the active workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Go to Top of Active File`: The `Home` key is bound to this command also.
1. `File Bunny: Go to End of Active File` The `End` key is bound to this command also.

## Backlog

1. `File Bunny: Open File`: Open a file from the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Open File to the Right`: Open a file from the current workspace split to the right of the active editor.
1. `File Bunny: Open File to the Left`: Open a file from the current workspace split to the left of the active editor.
1. `File Bunny: Open File Above`: Open a file from the current workspace split above the active editor.
1. `File Bunny: Open File Below`: Open a file from the current workspace split below the active editor.
1. `File Bunny: Create New Folder`: Create a new folder in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Duplicate Folder`: Duplicate a folder and place it somewhere in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Delete Folder`: Delete a folder from the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Copy File Name`: Copy the file name of the active file to the clipboard.
1. `File Bunny: Copy Relative Path`: Copy the relative file path of the active file to the clipboard. Same as built-in command.
1. `File Bunny: Copy Absolute Path`: Copy the absolute file path of the active file to the clipboard. Same as built-in command.
1. `File Bunny: Open Recent Folder`: Open a folder as the active workspace that was opened previously. Same as built-in command.

## Settings
