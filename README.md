No need to *hop* to the Sidebar to work with files. üòú

## Consolidated lists for quick file selection

For some file actions, we can consolidate the list of files into a single list for quick selection.

Take the command, `File Bunny: Move Active File`. A QuickPick dialog lets you choose a destination from all folders (and subfolders) in your workspace.

![move active file demo](img/move-file.gif)

The list is narrowed down to matched selections as you type, the same as with commands in the Command Palette.

You can exclude folders from the list with the `excludes` settings option to keep the list concise.

## Incremental completion to find files quickly

Incremental completion builds a filepath quickly. This is achieved through a QuickPick dialog populated with a file list, and tabbed autocompletion to append each segment.

Take the command, `File Bunny: Open a Folder`.

![open folder demo](img/open-folder.gif)

In this example, I do the following to open my *Beer Advisor* project:

1. Type "and", which highlights  the *Android* folder as the first option. Press `Tab` to select it.
2. Type "beer", which highlights the *beer-advisor* folder as the first option. Press `Tab` to select it.
3. Accept the current directory (first option) by pressing `Enter` to open it.

This process of building paths is quick and mitigates errors drastically. You cannot create an incorrect path.

You can also walk the file system with the arrow keys. Use the left arrow to go back, and right arrow to go forward through the file system if you need to search.

## Actions on the active file

Quite often, you want to do something to a file you're already working on. Why re-find the file in the sidebar to perform an action?

![delete active file demo](img/delete-file.gif)

For example, the command  `File Bunny: Delete Active File` will immediately delete the active file (it ends up in the trash).

After the file is deleted, focus is switched to the next open file. This way you can carry on editing without needing to switch view to return to an active state. Other extensions don't do this!

## Destructive actions are safe

If you delete a file, it is sent to the trash (recycle bin).

If you perform a file action such as moving a file, overwriting another file is not possible.

## Open files in default system app

There are times when you want to do something with a workspace file outside of VS Code.

You may want to perform some action on a group of files, so it's probably easier to open that folder in your system file manager and do it there. You can use the `File Bunny: Open Workspace Folder Externally` command, or the `File Bunny: Open Folder Externally` command to open a specific folder.

You may want to edit a file in an app specific to that file type. I often want to edit SVG images in my default editor (Inkscape). You can use the `File Bunny: Open File in External App` command to do this.

## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). They are categorised below:

### File actions

1. `File Bunny: Open File`: Choose a file to open from the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Open File to the Right`: Choose a file to open from the current workspace, and split it to the right of the active editor.
1. `File Bunny: Open File to the Left`: Choose a file to open from the current workspace, and split it to the left of the active editor.
1. `File Bunny: Open File Above`: Choose a file to open from the current workspace, and split it above the active editor.
1. `File Bunny: Open File Below`: Choose a file to open from the current workspace, and split it below the active editor.
1. `File Bunny: Open File in External Default App`: Choose a file to open from the current workspace in the system default app.

1. `File Bunny: Delete Active File`: Delete the active file. The file is put into the trash (recycle bin).

### Folder actions

1. `File Bunny: Open Folder`: Choose a folder to open as the workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Open Workspace Folder in External Default App`: Open the current workspace folder in the Operating Systems' file explorer.
1. `File Bunny: Open Folder in External Default App`: Open a folder from the current workspace in the Operating Systems' file explorer.
1. `File Bunny: Create New Folder`: Create a new folder in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Duplicate Folder`: Duplicate a folder from the current workspace, and place it somewhere in the current workspace.
1. `File Bunny: Delete Folder`: Delete a folder from the current workspace.

### Quick navigation

1. `File Bunny: Go to Top of Active File`
1. `File Bunny: Go to End of Active File`

### Quick metadata

1. `File Bunny: Copy File Name`: Copy the file name of the active file to the clipboard.
1. `File Bunny: Copy Relative Path`: Copy the relative file path of the active file to the clipboard.
1. `File Bunny: Copy Absolute Path`: Copy the absolute file path of the active file to the clipboard.

## Settings

- `Filebunny: Excludes`: Configure glob patterns for excluding files and folders from file lists for commands. By default, the *.git* and *node_modules* folders are ignored in your workspace.
- `Filebunny: Starting Location Open Folder`: The initial location shown in the QuickPick when you run the command `File Bunny: Open Folder`. If this field is empty or the path is invalid, it will default to the system home directory.  ![New command](/img/new.png)

## Keybindings

For multi-step commands such as `File Bunny: Create New File`, there are keybindings for the *next* and *previous* commands that enable you to go back and forth between steps. These keybindings are only active when you run a multi-step command.

| Keybinding  | Command Name   | Description | When Clause |
|-------------- | -------------- |-------------- |-------------- |
| `‚ûû` (right arrow key) <br/>, or `Tab` for `File Bunny: Open Folder`  | `filebunny.next`    | Skip to next step of a multi-step command | `inFileBunny` |
| `ü†î` (left arrow key) | `filebunny.back` | Go back to previous step of a multi-step command | `inFileBunny` |

If you want to modify these keybindings, you can read the [Key Bindings for Visual Studio Code guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) to learn how.

You can also check out my article, [VS Code keyboard-fu: custom keyboard shortcuts that will boost your productivity](https://www.roboleary.net/2022/02/28/vscode-keyboard-fu-custom-keyboard-shortcuts.html) where I discuss what keybindings I modify.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1) Does File Bunny support multi-root workspaces?

No. I don't use multi-root workspaces, so I have not implemented this feature. If you are interested in this feature, feel free to open an issue and mark it as an "enhancement". If there is enough interest, I will consider implementing it. The current behaviour for a multi-root workspace is that you will only be able to perform actions on the first folder of the workspace.

### 2) Why can't I delete an image and some non-code files with the command `File Bunny: Delete Active File` ?

This is a current limitation of VS Code. When you open an image in VS Code, the tab cannot be referenced through the Extensions API. There is an [open issue in the VS Code repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/15178) to change this. I have [an issue for this](https://github.com/robole/vscode-file-bunny/issues/4) and will change if/when Microsoft add this feature.

### 3) When I run the command `File Bunny: Open Folder` on Windows, I see extra folders at *C:*. What's the deal with that?

![Hidden system folders at C: that appear when browsing file system for command Open Folder](img/windows-c-drive-system-folders.png)

These are hidden system folders such as the recycle bin. You don't see these in the File Explorer, even if you turn on the "hidden files" setting. They are real files but are always kept hidden from users.

![View of C: in File Explorer](img/windows-c-drive-system-folders-explorer.png)

The reason this extension shows them is because it uses [node glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) under the hood, and glob dutifully reports these back as folders. If you open them, you can't do anything with them because of permissions.

This is not something I can turn off, it is just a quirk with Windows and glob. If it bothers you, add the specific folders to the `Filebunny: Excludes` setting, so that you won't see them in future.
